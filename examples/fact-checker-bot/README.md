# Fact-Checker Bot

A Discord bot that verifies claims in real time using [LastSearch](https://lastsearch.dev). Paste any claim and get an evidence-backed verdict with confidence scores, sources, and contradiction warnings.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `!verify <claim>` | Verify a claim with thorough evidence-backed research |
| `!fact <claim>` | Alias for `!verify` |
| `!compare <claim>` | Show raw LLM answer vs evidence-backed answer side by side |

## Setup

### 1. Create a Discord Bot

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Click **New Application**, give it a name like "Fact Checker"
3. Go to **Bot** tab, click **Reset Token**, and copy the token
4. Under **Privileged Gateway Intents**, enable **Message Content Intent**
5. Go to **OAuth2 > URL Generator**, select `bot` scope with permissions: Send Messages, Embed Links, Read Message History
6. Use the generated URL to invite the bot to your server

### 2. Get a LastSearch API Key

Sign up at [lastsearch.dev](https://lastsearch.dev) and get your API key (starts with `ls_`).

### 3. Install and Run

```bash
# Clone the repo and navigate to this example
cd examples/fact-checker-bot

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set environment variables
export DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN="your-discord-bot-token"
export LASTSEARCH_API_KEY="ls_your_key_here"

# Run the bot
python bot.py
```

You can also create a `.env` file in this directory:

```env
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your-discord-bot-token
LASTSEARCH_API_KEY=ls_your_key_here
```

## How It Works

```
User sends: !verify The Great Wall of China is visible from space
                |
                v
    +---------------------------+
    |  LastSearch ask() API       |
    |  depth="thorough"         |
    |                           |
    |  1. Web search (Tavily)   |
    |  2. Fetch top sources     |
    |  3. Extract claims + LLM  |
    |  4. Claim verification     |
    |  5. Cross-source consensus|
    |  6. Contradiction check   |
    |  7. Evidence-based scoring |
    |  8. Auto-retry if < 60%   |
    +---------------------------+
                |
                v
    Discord embed with verdict
```

Thorough mode automatically retries with a rephrased query if the first-pass confidence is below 60%, giving you higher quality results for tricky claims.

## Architecture

The bot is intentionally simple -- a single `bot.py` file with no framework overhead:

- **`discord.py`** handles the Discord gateway connection and message events
- **`AsyncLastSearch`** (the async Python SDK client) calls the LastSearch API without blocking the event loop
- The bot listens for `!verify`, `!fact`, and `!compare` prefixes, extracts the claim text, and dispatches to the appropriate handler
- Results are formatted into Discord embeds with color-coded confidence (green/yellow/red)
- The `typing()` context manager shows "Bot is typing..." while the API call is in progress

The heavy lifting (search, extraction, verification, confidence scoring) all happens server-side in LastSearch. The bot is just a thin presentation layer.

## Tips

- **Thorough mode** takes 5-15 seconds because it does multi-pass research. Users see the typing indicator while it works.
- **Rate limits**: Without a LastSearch API key, the demo limit is 1 query/hour. Get an API key for unlimited use.
- **Hosting**: For a production bot, run with `systemd`, Docker, or a cloud VM. The bot is stateless so it can restart freely.
