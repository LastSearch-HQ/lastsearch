# Content Agent

Write blog posts where every stat, claim, and fact is verified with real citations. No hallucinated numbers.

The Content Agent takes a topic, researches it across multiple angles using LastSearch sessions, writes a cited blog post, and runs a final verification sweep. Every claim gets a source citation, every statistic gets a confidence score, and contradictions between sources are explicitly called out.

## How it works

The agent runs four phases:

### Phase 1: Research

Creates a LastSearch research session and runs 6 queries covering different angles of the topic:

- Latest statistics and data
- Current trends and developments
- Challenges and concerns
- Expert opinions and predictions
- Real-world examples and case studies
- Economic impact and market size

All queries use `depth="thorough"` which auto-retries with rephrased queries when initial confidence is below 60%.

### Phase 2: Outline

Creates a structured blog post outline with 8 sections:

1. Introduction
2. By the Numbers: Key Statistics
3. Current Trends and Developments
4. Challenges and Concerns
5. Expert Perspectives
6. Real-World Examples
7. What Lies Ahead
8. Conclusion

### Phase 3: Write

For each section, the agent writes content using ONLY verified claims from the research:

- Every statistic gets an inline confidence score: `(**85% confidence**)` or `(*62% confidence*)`
- Every claim gets source citations: `[1]`, `[2]`, etc.
- Contradictions are called out as blockquotes: `> Note: Sources disagree on...`
- Unverified claims are marked with `*(unverified)*`
- Duplicate claims across queries are deduplicated

### Phase 4: Verify

Runs the entire draft through LastSearch's `ask` endpoint one more time to catch any remaining unverified claims. Aggregates all contradictions from every research query into a final report.

## Output

The agent produces a markdown file containing:

- Inline citations `[1]`, `[2]` throughout the text
- Confidence scores next to key statistics
- A **Sources** section with numbered references (URL, title, domain)
- A **Verification Report** showing:
  - X/Y claims verified (with percentage)
  - Number of contradictions found
  - Average confidence across all research queries
  - List of unverified statements

The terminal also shows a **Before vs After** comparison:

- **Before:** A raw LLM draft with fabricated statistics (no citations, no verification)
- **After:** The verified draft with real data, citations, and confidence scores

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set your API key:

```bash
export LASTSEARCH_API_KEY=ls_xxx
```

Or the script will prompt you for it.

## Usage

### Pass a topic as an argument

```bash
python agent.py "Impact of AI on software engineering jobs"
```

### Interactive mode

```bash
python agent.py
# Enter blog post topic: The state of remote work in 2026
```

### Custom output file

```bash
python agent.py "AI in healthcare" -o healthcare-post.md
```

### Skip the Before vs After comparison

```bash
python agent.py "Quantum computing progress" --no-compare
```

## Example: AI and Software Engineering Jobs

```bash
python agent.py "Impact of AI on software engineering jobs"
```

The agent will:

1. Research the topic across 6 queries (statistics, trends, challenges, expert views, examples, economic impact)
2. Create a blog post outline with 8 sections
3. Write each section using only verified claims from LastSearch
4. Run a final verification sweep
5. Save the result to `impact-of-ai-on-software-engineering-jobs.md`

## How verification works

The Content Agent relies on LastSearch's verification pipeline:

| Step | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| Web search | Finds relevant sources across the web |
| Claim verification | Extracts and verifies claims against source text |
| Cross-source consensus | Claims verified across multiple independent sources |
| Domain authority | Domains scored with dynamic authority scoring |
| Contradiction detection | Identifies conflicting claims across sources |
| Evidence-based confidence | Analyzes multiple quality signals from sources |

The `depth="thorough"` mode auto-retries with a rephrased query when confidence is below 60%, ensuring higher-quality results.
