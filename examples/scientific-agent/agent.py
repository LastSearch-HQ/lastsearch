Scientific Agent — LastSearch Example

Cross-checks research findings and detects contradictions in scientific
literature. Uses deep mode for iterative gap analysis with follow-up
searches, ideal for complex topics where consensus is evolving.

Usage:
    pip install lastsearch
    LASTSEARCH_API_KEY=ls_xxx python agent.py
    LASTSEARCH_API_KEY=ls_xxx python agent.py "Current consensus on dark matter vs modified gravity"
