# Financial Agent

A financial research agent that verifies market data and financial claims with real-time evidence. Built on [LastSearch](https://lastsearch.ai).

## What it does

- Verifies financial figures (revenue, earnings, delivery numbers) against multiple sources
- Detects contradictions from different reporting periods or GAAP vs non-GAAP
- Shows consensus levels so you know which numbers are widely confirmed
- Ranks sources by domain authority (prioritizing financial data providers, SEC filings)
- Uses `depth="thorough"` for multi-pass verification of time-sensitive data

## How to run

```bash
pip install lastsearch
export LASTSEARCH_API_KEY=ls_xxx
python agent.py
```

Or pass a custom query:

```bash
python agent.py "Apple quarterly earnings Q1 2026"
```

## What it demonstrates

- **Real-time data**: Financial numbers from live web search, not stale training data
- **Thorough mode**: Cross-checks figures across multiple financial sources
- **Contradiction detection**: Catches discrepancies between GAAP/non-GAAP, preliminary/final
- **Source authority**: Financial sources ranked by credibility

## Example queries

```bash
python agent.py "Tesla revenue and delivery numbers 2025"
python agent.py "Apple quarterly earnings Q1 2026"
python agent.py "S&P 500 performance year to date 2026"
python agent.py "Federal Reserve interest rate decisions 2025-2026"
```
