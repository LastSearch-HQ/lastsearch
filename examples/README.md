## Tutorials

Full project tutorials — each with its own README, working code, and setup instructions.

| Tutorial | What You'll Build | Features Used |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|
| [coding-agent/](coding-agent/) | Agent that researches before writing code — never recommends deprecated libraries | Ask (thorough), Code Research |
| [support-agent/](support-agent/) | Agent that verifies answers before responding — escalates when confidence is low | Ask (fast), Confidence Thresholds |
| [content-agent/](content-agent/) | Agent that writes blog posts where every stat has a citation and confidence score | Ask (thorough), Citations, Writing |
| [fact-checker-bot/](fact-checker-bot/) | Discord bot that verifies any claim with `!verify` and `!compare` | Ask (thorough), Compare, AsyncLastSearch |
| [is-this-true/](is-this-true/) | Web app — paste any sentence, get a confidence score and sources | Ask, Streaming, FastAPI |
| [debate-settler/](debate-settler/) | CLI tool — two claims battle it out, evidence decides the winner | Ask (thorough), Contradictions |
| [docs-verifier/](docs-verifier/) | Verify every factual claim in your README or docs | Ask, Open, Extract |
| [podcast-prep/](podcast-prep/) | Research brief builder for podcast interviews | Sessions, Recall, Knowledge Export |

## How it works

```
Agent → LastSearch → Internet / Enterprise Data → Verified answers + sources
```

LastSearch is **research infrastructure for AI agents** — every answer comes with real sources, confidence scores, and verified claims. Works with internet search out of the box, or plug in enterprise data sources (Elasticsearch, Confluence, custom endpoints).
