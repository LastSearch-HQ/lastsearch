Education Agent — LastSearch Example

A research assistant for students and researchers. Uses deep mode to
explore complex questions with iterative gap analysis, providing
evidence-backed answers with full citations for academic use.

Usage:
    pip install lastsearch
    LASTSEARCH_API_KEY=ls_xxx python agent.py
    LASTSEARCH_API_KEY=ls_xxx python agent.py "What was before the Big Bang?"
