"""
Healthcare Agent — LastSearch Example

Verifies medical claims using evidence-backed research with contradiction
detection. Uses thorough mode to cross-check findings across multiple
medical sources, ensuring claims are supported by current evidence.

Usage:
    pip install lastsearch
    LASTSEARCH_API_KEY=ls_xxx python agent.py
    LASTSEARCH_API_KEY=ls_xxx python agent.py "Is intermittent fasting safe for diabetics?"
