# lastsearch

**Reliable research infrastructure for AI agents.** The research layer your agents are missing.

MCP server with real-time web search, evidence extraction, and structured citations. Drop into Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, LangChain, CrewAI, or any agent pipeline.

## What it does

Instead of letting your AI hallucinate, `lastsearch` gives it real-time access to the web with **structured, cited answers**:

```
Your question → Web search → Neural rerank → Fetch pages → Extract claims → Verify → Cited answer (streamed)
```

Every answer includes:
- **Claims** with source URLs, verification status, and consensus level
- **Evidence-based confidence score** (0-1), not LLM self-assessed, auto-calibrated from feedback
- **Source quotes** verified against actual page text
- **Atomic claim decomposition** — compound facts split and verified independently
- **Execution trace** with timing
- **3 depth modes** — `"fast"` (default), `"thorough"` (auto-retry with rephrased queries), `"deep"` (premium multi-step agentic research: iterative think-search-extract-evaluate cycles with gap analysis, up to 4 steps, targets 0.85 confidence — requires BAI key + sign-in, 3x quota cost, falls back to thorough when exhausted)

### Premium Features (with `LASTSEARCH_API_KEY`)

Users with a LastSearch API key (`ls_xxx`) get enhanced verification:
- **Semantic re-ranking** — search results re-scored by semantic query-document relevance
- **Semantic reranking** — evidence matched by meaning, not just keywords
- **Multi-provider search** — parallel search across multiple sources for broader coverage
- **Multi-pass consistency** — claims cross-checked across independent extraction passes
- **Deep reasoning mode** — multi-step agentic research with iterative think-search-extract-evaluate cycles, gap analysis, and cross-step claim merging (up to 4 steps, 3x quota cost, 100 deep queries/day)
- **Research Sessions** — persistent memory across queries

Free BAI key users get a generous daily quota (100 premium queries/day, or ~33 deep queries/day at 3x cost each). When exceeded, queries gracefully fall back to keyword verification (deep falls back to thorough). Quota resets every 24 hours.

Sign up at [lastsearch.dev](https://lastsearch.dev) for a free API key — 100 premium queries/day with full verification pipeline.

## Quick Start

```bash
npx lastsearch setup
```

This auto-configures Claude Desktop. You'll need a LastSearch API key — get one free at [lastsearch.dev/dashboard](https://lastsearch.dev/dashboard).

## Manual Setup

### Claude Desktop

Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lastsearch": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "lastsearch"],
      "env": {
        "LASTSEARCH_API_KEY": "ls_xxx"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor / Windsurf

Add to your MCP settings:

```json
{
  "lastsearch": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "lastsearch"],
    "env": {
      "LASTSEARCH_API_KEY": "ls_xxx"
    }
  }
}
```

### HTTP Transport

Run as an HTTP server for browser-based clients, Smithery, or any HTTP-capable agent:

```bash
# Start with HTTP transport
npx lastsearch --http

# Or set the port via environment variable
MCP_HTTP_PORT=3100 npx lastsearch --http
```

The server exposes:
- `POST /mcp` — MCP Streamable HTTP endpoint
- `GET /health` — Health check

### Docker

```bash
docker build -t lastsearch ./apps/mcp
docker run -p 3100:3100 -e LASTSEARCH_API_KEY=ls_xxx lastsearch
```

## MCP Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `search` | Search the web via multi-provider search |
| `open` | Fetch and parse a page into clean text |
| `extract` | Extract structured knowledge from a page |
| `answer` | Full pipeline: search + extract + cite. `depth`: `"fast"`, `"thorough"`, or `"deep"` |
| `compare` | Compare raw LLM vs evidence-backed answer |
| `clarity` | Clarity — anti-hallucination answer engine. Three modes: `mode: "prompt"` (enhanced prompts only), `mode: "answer"` (LLM answer, default), `mode: "verified"` (LLM + web fusion) |
| `session_create` | Create a research session (persistent memory across queries) |
| `session_ask` | Research within a session (recalls prior knowledge, stores new claims) |
| `session_recall` | Query session knowledge without new web searches |
| `session_share` | Share a session publicly (returns share URL) |
| `session_knowledge` | Export all claims from a session |
| `session_fork` | Fork a shared session to continue the research |
| `feedback` | Submit accuracy feedback on a result |

> **Note:** All tools require a LastSearch API key (`ls_xxx`). Get a free one at [lastsearch.dev/dashboard](https://lastsearch.dev/dashboard).

## Examples

**Quick lookup:**
> *"Use answer to explain what causes aurora borealis"*

**Higher accuracy:**
> *"Use answer with depth thorough to research quantum computing"*

**Deep research (multi-step, requires BAI key):**
> *"Use answer with depth deep to compare CRISPR approaches for sickle cell disease"*
>
> Deep mode runs iterative think-search-extract-evaluate cycles: gap analysis identifies missing info, follow-up queries fill the gaps, and claims/sources are merged across steps with final re-verification. Targets 0.85 confidence across up to 4 steps. Falls back to thorough without a BAI key or when quota is exhausted.

**Contradiction detection:**
> *"Use answer with depth thorough to check if coffee is good for health, and show me any contradictions"*

**Research session:**
> *"Create a session called quantum-research, then ask about quantum entanglement, then ask how entanglement is used in computing"*

**Enterprise search:**
> *"Use answer to search our Elasticsearch at https://es.company.com/kb/_search for our refund policy"*
