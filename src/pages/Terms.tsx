            <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              By using LastSearch ("the Service"), including the website at lastsearch.ai, the REST API, MCP server, and Python SDK, you agree to these terms. If you don't agree, don't use the Service.

            <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              LastSearch provides AI-powered research infrastructure: web search with evidence extraction, structured citations, and confidence scoring. Results are generated from real-time web searches and LLM processing. We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of any results.

              You may use the Service without an account (subject to demo rate limits). Creating an account gives you access to API key management, query history, and higher usage limits. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and API keys.
